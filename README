SaLT: Salix Live Template

Set of tools to create a full live environnement for Slackware/Salix using:
  - a custom live kernel using Aufs2 and Squashfs+lzma (patches for multiple kernel version until availabile in mainline);
  - a special initrd template;
  - some tools to exploit live environnement.

These scripts is a base to help you built a slackware live.
It will not build the modules for you or organize the final architecture: it focuses on the initrd.
It could possibly be modified to run other distro than Slackware.

Based on ideas from LLS (ftp://ftp.slax.org/Linux-Live/) and SLS (https://github.com/godane/slackware-live/).
Why a new project? Because LLS is not compatible with 64 bits and not maintained and SaLT has not the same purpose as SLS.

These scripts could be used for Salix or any other Slackware-compatible distribution, in 32 or 64 bits.
These scripts will not handle all possibilities of LLS or SLS at first. Things will be added further, in a proper way.
