Don't touch the mount points here if you're in chroot.
This could be modified only in initrd mode.

Information:

/mnt/rw: link to either /mnt/ram or /mnt/save, used for writable branch for the union
/mnt/ram: tmpfs for saving changes
/mnt/save: xfs mount point for saving changes
/mnt/xino: tmpfs for keeping xino files (used for aufs2)
/mnt/modules/*: readonly branches loaded in the union
/mnt/union: the actual union filesystem

Other moinpoints are for mounting the CD/DVD or the USB key and other partitions found on the computer which are needed to, i.e., load a persistent file.
