# How to install Salix Live on a USB key? #
###########################################

It depends if you already have a Salix Live CD or simply an ISO image.
Unetbootin is only supported from the version 576 and above. Check the
version of your unetbootin before making reports.

These mostly automatized methods to install the LiveCD to an USB only
support sticks formatted as FAT (FAT16, FAT32, VFAT), as supported by
syslinux, and a MBR partition table (no GPT). If you don't know what
this means, you most probably have such a stick. Other setups are very
uncommon and require you to do all the work manually.

If you have any important data on the stick, please do create a backup
before continuing! Also we've carefully written those scripts to
protect your data, we make no guarantees whatsoever.


# From a Salix Live CD #
########################

    Boot a Live session from the CD.
    Insert your USB key.
    Use LiveClone.


# From an ISO image #
#####################

1. You need to at least install parted and syslinux.
2. Open the ISO file using a software archiver (file-roller, xarchiver,
   7-zip, iso-master, ...)
3. Extract all files and folders (boot, packages, salixlive and
   salix-<...>.live) to your USB root directory
3. Go to the "boot" directory on the USB key.
    o If you're on Unix (Linux, BSD, Mac OS X), simply execute the file
      called "install-on-USB.sh" (root privileges are required)
    o If you're on Windows, execute the file called
      "install-on-USB.cmd" instead.

# From an ISO image (alternate method) #
########################################

The ISO image is in fact a ISO Hybrid image, so that it is also a valid
disk image.
So you can "dd" it to your device and this will boot with no problem.
The only drawback is that you will LOOSE ALL YOUR DATA on the USB stick,
and the remaining space can not be used easily.

Here how to do it:
On Linux, BSD:
  1. Ensure that your USB key is unmounted.
  2. Open a root terminal emulator in the folder you have your ISO.
  3. Type "blkid" and search for your USB key partition.
  4. Note the device of your USB key, this means if your partition is
     /dev/sdb1 then your device is /dev/sdb.
     BE CAREFUL, if you make a mistake you will ERASE ALL YOUR DATA.
  5. Issue:
     dd if=YOUR_LIVE_DISTRO.iso of=/dev/DEVICE bs=1M ; sync
On Windows and Mac OS X:
  Follow the instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles
  These are for another distro, but apply the same.
