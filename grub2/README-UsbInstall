# How to install Salix Live on a USB key? #
###########################################

It depends if you already have a Salix Live CD or simply an ISO image.
In any case, Unetbootin is not supported and should not be used.

These mostly automatized methods to install the LiveCD to an USB only
support sticks formatted as FAT (FAT16, FAT32, VFAT), as supported by
syslinux, and a MBR partition table (no GPT). If you don't know what
this means, you most probably have such a stick. Other setups are very
uncommon and require you to do all the work manually.

If you have any important data on the stick, please do create a backup
before continuing! Also we've carefully written those scripts to
protect your data, we make no guarantees whatsoever.


# From a Salix Live CD #
########################

    Boot a Live session from the CD.
    Insert your USB key.
    Use LiveClone.


# From an ISO image #
#####################

1. You need to at least install parted and syslinux. Installation of
   lilo is optional, but highly recommended.
2. Open the ISO file using a software archiver (file-roller, xarchiver,
   7-zip, iso-master, ...)
3. Extract all files and folders (boot, packages, salixlive and
   salix-<...>.live) to your USB root directory
3. Go to the "boot" directory on the USB key.
    o If you're on Unix (Linux, BSD, Max OS X), simply execute the file
      called "install-on-USB.sh" (root privileges are required)
    o If you're on Windows, execute the file called
      "install-on-USB.cmd" instead.
